/**
 * QUESTIONS:
 * 
 * 1. In Dijkstra's algorithm, what data structure do we
 *    use to traverse our nodes in the proper order?
 * 
 * 2. Could we perform Dijkstra's algorithm if our graph
 *    has negative edge weights?
 * 
 * 3. What values does each node store in order to perform
 *    dijkstra's algorithm on a graph?
 * 
 * 4. In Dijkstra's algorithm, we have three sub-operations
 *    that we analyzed to help us determine dijkstra's time
 *    complexity. For each of the operations below, explain
 *    what each one is doing:
 *      a) Init-single-source
 *      b) Q = G.V
 *      c) Extract-min
 *      d) Relax
 * 
 * 5. For each of the sub-operations above, list each of their
 *    time complexities and explain why that is the case.
 * 
 * 6. What is the overall time complexity of Dijkstra's algorithm?
 *    why is that the case?
 * 
 * 7. After performing Dijkstra's algorithm, how can we obtain the
 *    path from the source node S to the destination node D?
 *    
 * 8. How would the time complexity change for each sub operation
 *    if we used a sorted list instead of a priority queue?
