 * QUESTIONS:
 * 
 * 1. What is a minimum spanning tree and what are its 
 *    properties?
 * 
 * 2. What data structures are used in Kruskal's algorithm
 *    to compute the MST?
 * 
 * 3. In what order does Kruskal's algorithm consider edges
 *    and what data structure does it use to do so?
 * 
 * 4. How does Kruskal's algorithm decide to add an edge to
 *    the MST or not?
 * 
 * 5. How is Prim's algorithm differnt than Kruskal's? How is
 *    it similar?
 * 
 * 6. What data structure does Prim's algorithm use to consider
 *    the edges in the proper order?
 * 
 * 7. How does Prim's decide whether or not to add an edge to
 *    the MST or not?
